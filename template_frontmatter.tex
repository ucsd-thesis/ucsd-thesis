\makefrontmatter % The title, copyright, and signature pages.

%% DEDICATION
% You have three choices here:
%   1. Use the ``dedication'' environment.   Put in the text you want,
%   and you'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
%
%   2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
%   formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
%   however you wish.
%
%   3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.


% The style file will format this for you.
\begin{dedication} 
  To two, the loneliest number since the number one.
\end{dedication}

% \begin{mydedication} % You are responsible for formatting here.
%   \vspace{1in}
%   \begin{flushleft}
% 	To me.
%   \end{flushleft}
%   
%   \vspace{2in}
%   \begin{center}
% 	And you.
%   \end{center}
% 
%   \vspace{2in}
%   \begin{flushright}
% 	Which equals us.
%   \end{flushright}
% \end{mydedication}



%% EPIGRAPH
%  The same choices that applied to the dedication apply here.
\begin{epigraph} % The style file will position the text for you.
  \emph{A careful quotation\\
  conveys brilliance.}\\
  ---Smarty Pants
\end{epigraph}

% \begin{myepigraph} % You position the text yourself.
%   \vfil
%   \begin{center}
%     {\bf Think! It ain't illegal yet.}
